## Versioning Strategy
### Semantic Versioning
This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- **MAJOR** version (X.0.0): Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version (0.X.0): Backwards-compatible functionality additions
- **PATCH** version (0.0.X): Backwards-compatible bug fixes

### Version Tags
- Development versions: `v0.0.X-dev`
- Alpha releases: `v0.X.0-alpha`
- Beta releases: `v0.X.0-beta`
- Release candidates: `v0.X.0-rc.1`
- Production releases: `vX.X.X`

### Branching Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: New features
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*`: Emergency fixes
- `release/*`: Release preparation

## Common Commands
```bash
# Git operations
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main

# Version tagging
